          measures according to the severity of the clinical picture (e.g. oxygen
          administration, balance of the fluid balance, possibly antibiotics for the
          treatment of bacterial superinfections). In Germany, clinical studies are
          to show whether the Ebola drug remdesivir helps against the new coronavirus,
          and some patients have already shown very good therapeutic effects. The
          German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices has given approval
          to treat 19 patients with Remdesivir, which are particularly difficult for
          Kowitt. The European Medicines Agency EMA had announced that there are first
          signs that remdesivir is also effective against the coronavirus. Furthermore,
          research is being carried out on the active ingredient APN 0 1, which could
          soon be ready for use. However, it would probably only help in the phase
          of the disease before patients would have to be transferred to the intensive
          care unit. The Guardian also reports on the anti-flu drug Avigan. It is
          said to have shown good results and few side effects in tests on Chinese
          Covid-19 patients. However, the remedy only seems to work in patients with
          milder symptoms. From China there was also a report that the malaria drug
          chloroquine could help against the coronavirus. But that is not certain.

          the SARS Koff 2 coronavirus. It is estimated that up to 70% of the population,
          but it is unclear how long this will happen. The basis of these estimates
          is the so-called base reproduction number of Kowitt 19. It is 2-3. This
          means that a contagious person infects 2 to 3 other people. The effects

          only a small part of the illnesses is difficult, an unchecked wave of illnesses
          could lead to a considerable burden of illness in Germany due to the lack
          of immunity. </speak>

      - ssml: <speak> There are significant differences in the masks. On the one hand
          there is the self-made mouth-nose protection (MNS), which can be sewn from
          fabric. Instructions are available online. These masks do not protect against
          virus infection, but can trap droplets when speaking, coughing, or sneezing,
          protecting others from infection. There are also professionally manufactured
          MNS, which the Robert Koch Institute defines as multi-layer, close-fitting
          mouth and nose protection. Even professionally manufactured MNS half masks
          do not protect the wearer from viruses, but can collect droplets from the
          wearer. There are also certified masks with protective functions that should
          be reserved for use in hospitals, so that staff do not become infected.
          These masks are called FFP (filtering facepiece) masks, and they meet certain
          requirements for filtering particles. FFP2 masks should only be used once.
          Due to the acute shortage, the RKI recommends that the masks be used again.
          However, a number of precautions need to be taken. FFP-3 masks have the
          highest protection level and are also intended to protect against carcinogenic
          or radioactive particles. Because the filter is very tight, breathing with
          these masks is difficult. Therefore, they can only be worn for a short time.

      - ssml: '<speak> In addition to the simple fleece masks, which are worn like
          cloths over the mouth and nose, there are half masks that filter particles
          from the air: so-called FFP masks. They are available as three different
          types. <br> FFP1: Protects against normal dust in the air <br> FFP2: Protects
          against fog, smoke and harmful dust in the air <br> FFP3: Protects against
          toxic, carcinogenic and radioactive substances and microorganisms such as
          bacteria, fungi and viruses in the air <br> But: High-quality masks of these
          high protection classes have valves that release the wearer''s breathing
          air to the outside. If the carrier is infected, it would also expel viruses.
          In addition, the protective effect of these masks is not unlimited, so they
          have to be changed at regular intervals. <br> Because their safe use is
          demanding and, above all, because there is a shortage of these professional
          masks, they should be reserved for medical personnel until further notice.

          coronaviruses. There are still no cases where infection from imported toys

          the pathogens can remain infectious for up to 24 hours on cardboard and
          up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. In general, human corona
          viruses are not particularly stable on dry surfaces. Because the stability
          of viruses outside the human organism depends on many environmental factors
          such as temperature and humidity, infection by post seems rather unlikely.
          The transmission of SARS Koff 2 via contaminated food is classified as unlikely.

          ordered after a stay of several days abroad. This also applies to Germans.
          So far, returnees from high-risk areas have only been asked to stay at home
          for 14 days and avoid unnecessary contacts - regardless of whether there
          is a specific suspected corona case. Due to the pandemic spread of Kowitt
          19, an infection risk can be assumed worldwide. The RKI therefore no longer
          identifies any particularly affected risk areas. Passengers and passengers
          are obliged to provide identity, travel route and contact details. The respective
          carriers must collect them and send them to the responsible authorities.
          This is done using a drop-off card and is used to track contact persons.

      - ssml: <speak> If there is a loss of work due to loss of earnings, for example
          because delivery bottlenecks occur as a result of the corona virus and the
          company is subsequently only able to work to a limited extent or not at
          all, the employees concerned are entitled to short-time work benefits. Short-time
          work benefits can be granted for a period of up to twelve months. Short-time
          work benefit is paid in the same amount as unemployment benefit and is 67
          or 60 percent of the difference between the flat-rate net salary that would
          have been paid without loss of work and the flat-rate net salary from the
          actual salary received. The responsible employment agency will check in
          individual cases whether the requirements for granting short-time work benefits
          are met.On the website of the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
