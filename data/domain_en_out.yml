          take the global case numbers and divide them by the number of deaths. Then
          you get a mortality rate of around 4 percent. This means that four out of
          100 infected people fall victim to the virus. However, this calculation
          ignores the fact that there are overlooked cases. If one were to include
          these cases, the mortality rate would be approximately 0.5-1 percent. In
          Germany, the mortality rate is currently around 0.4 percent. In contrast,
          according to the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the mortality rate
          in Italy was about 20 times higher in the week of March 24, 2020. <a href

      - text: <speak> The wages for workers are still secured both when an individual
          is quarantined and when an entire city is cordoned off. In Germany, the
          Infection Protection Act ensures that the remuneration is paid for six weeks
          after the start of the loss of earnings. If the quarantine continues after
          the six weeks, sick pay is paid. If, on the other hand, the employer voluntarily
          says that he will close the company, he is obliged to continue paying the
          wages. This also applies if the closure was not voluntary. Situations like
          this are part of his operational risk. On the website of the Federal Ministry

          received. The responsible employment agency will check in individual cases
          whether the conditions for granting short-time allowance are met.
